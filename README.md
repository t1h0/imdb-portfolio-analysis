# IMDB portfolio analysis

What are the main topics in all TV shows / movies, artists on IMDB are associated with?

## What is it?

The script provides methods for scraping information about a person's opuses on [IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/) and complements them with meta info (especially plot descriptions) via [OMDB](https://www.omdbapi.com/). Additionally, TF-IDF means over all movie plot descriptions can be computed and rather rudimentary analyses of these are provided.

## Disclaimer

This was my final submission for a python course during my master's studies.
